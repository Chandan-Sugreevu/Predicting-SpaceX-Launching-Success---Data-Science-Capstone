üöÄ Applied Data Science Capstone
The Applied Data Science Capstone serves as the final and most comprehensive course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization. This capstone consolidates all the knowledge acquired throughout the specialization into a real-world data science project, reinforcing key concepts and practical applications.

üìú Project Overview
The SpaceX Reusability Challenge
SpaceX has revolutionized the commercial space industry by drastically reducing the cost of space travel. While traditional space launch providers charge over $165 million per launch, SpaceX offers Falcon 9 launches at approximately $62 million‚Äîa significant reduction achieved through reusable first-stage rockets.

The central goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of a Falcon 9 first-stage landing successfully, enabling insights into reusability and cost savings. By leveraging publicly available data and machine learning models, we will analyze critical factors that influence the reusability of SpaceX rockets.

‚ùì Key Research Questions
To better understand the factors influencing first-stage rocket landings, this project aims to answer the following critical questions:

Impact of Key Variables: How do parameters like payload mass, launch site, number of previous flights, and orbital trajectory affect the success of first-stage landings?

Trend Analysis: Has the success rate of first-stage landings improved over the years?

Model Performance: What is the most effective machine learning algorithm for predicting whether a Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully?
